"""
This script may be useful to format the ETRM config file ETRM_CONFIG.yml You should be able to generate a yml file
for a given number of runs, with certain specs. Default specs can be selected.

1) Start with a config file. The options available in the config file that you select will be the config options
available for modification (this particular script only formats the taw of the config).

2) Provide the program with the path to the config file. Give a starting uniform taw, give an ending uniform taw and
 give a step interval

3) The taw_grid_search function will build out a config file that has all the same config parameters but repeats with
 TAW increasing by the step interval provided by the user.

NOTE: It would be good for the config file to look something like this:
