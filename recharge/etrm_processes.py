        """ Calculate dual crop coefficients, then transpiration, stage one and stage two evaporations.

        The well-established FAO Penman-Monteith dual crop coefficient(DCC) method finds a reference evapotranspiration
        value from which actual transpiration can be derived.  See GADGET documentation for a description of tall crop
        reference ET (etrs). By accounting for soil water, actual evapotranspiration (eta) can be estimated by
        calculating a stress factor coefficient Ks, a basal vegetation transpiration coefficient Kcb, and a bare
        surface evaporation coefficient Ke, and multiplying them by etrs. This method is known
        as the dual-crop-coefficient method (Allan et al., 1998).  Jensen and others (1990) found that of 20 ET
        estimation methods, results varied considerably in varying climates and showed the need for rigorous
        and expensive calibration methods when a method developed in one climate was then applied to another.
        The FAO Penman-Monteith was devised in the 1990s as a method that needed less rigorous local
        calibration than other, more empirical and local methods such as the BCM and INFIL.  The operational
        goal of the method is to find a constrained and reasonable estimate of ET with a minimum of climate data
        inputs.  The method contains many possible variations to allow for the continuation of the ET calculation
        despite missing or incomplete data.  Jabloun and Sahli (2008) found that use of FAO-56 recommended
        methods of calculating ET with missing data produced results close to those found using complete data.

        This dual crop coefficient makes use of a modified skin layer evaporation mechanism, as described in
        Allen (2011).  This has the cost of added uncertainty in the skin layer thickness and rew terms but
        the benefit of modeling the rapid evaporation that occurs after a small wetting event, which is limited
        only by available energy.

        The initial calculations are a roundabout way of finding the fraction of the ground that is covered
        by vegetation (fcov) and that which is not (few).  The exponent is intended to account for the effect
        that plant height has on shading the ground.  The equation has the implicit assumption that kcb
        is controlled by the fraction of vegetative cover, which at this time is calculated with the NDVI. In
        a locale with only bare soil, fcov = 0.01, few = 0.99.

        To find transpiration, the DCC calculates a root-zone transpiration stress coefficient, Ks. Ks depends
        on the amount of water in the root zone relative to water capacity, taw.  If the root zone is in a state
        of maximum water (i.e., at field capacity), there is no limit on transpiration by the soil. Therefore Ks is
        one.  As the root zone is depleted of water by transpiration, the soil dries, increasing the depletion (dr).
        As the difference between depletion and taw increases, Ks decreases, causing a reduction in the rate
        of transpiration. The basal crop coefficient (kcb) is simply the ratio of ET from a specific crop
        compared to the reference ET given current meteorological conditions. Kcb ranges from zero for a
        dry soil losing no water to ET, to perhaps 1.20 for a well watered crop transpiring at a high rate.
        The final factor needed to estimate transpiration is the tall crop reference ET (etrs).  This is the
        rate of ET for a well watered crop of alfalfa, 0.5 m height, in good growing conditions.  See GADGET
        documentation for details and derivation.

        To find evaporation, the ETRM makes use of the common differentiation of stage one and stage two evaporation.
        Stage one evaporation is the vaporization of water of which the rate is controlled principally by
        atmospheric conditions.  Thus, available energy in the form of radiation and sensible heat, and the
        aerodynamic effects of wind and surface texture. This process is not controlled by soil water content;
        the conditions immediately above the soil control the rate of evaporation.  Stage two evaporation
        is controlled by the process of diffusion of water vapor through the soil.  The water vapor pressure gradient
        upwards from damp soil to drier soil at the surface controls the rate at which water leaves the soil.
        Therefore, if the soil is very wet at some depth, but very dry at a shallower depth, the process will occur
        at a greater rate than if the underlying soil was drier, as the gradient is greater. The ETRM attempts to
        model this process.

    def _do_snow(self):
        """ Calibrated snow model that runs using PRISM temperature and precipitation.

        The ETRM snow model takes a simple approach to modeling the snow cycle.  PRISM temperature and
        precipitation are used to account for snowfall.  The mean of the maximum and minimum daily temperature
        is found; any precipitation falling during a day when this mean temperature is less than 0 C is assumed
        to be sored as snow.  While other snow-modeling techniques assume that a transition zone exists over
        which the percent of precipitation falling as snow varies over a range of elevation or temperature,
        the ETRM assumes all precipitation on any given day falls either entirely as snow or as rain.
        The storage mechanism in the ETRM simply stores the snow as a snow water equivalent (SWE).
        No attempt is made to model the temporal and spatially-varying density and texture of snow
        during its duration in the snow pack, nor to model the effect the snow has on the underlying soil
        layers.  In the ETRM, ablation of snow by sublimation and the movement of snow by wind is ignored.
        In computing the melting rate of snowpack in above-freezing conditions, a balance has been sought between the
        use of available physical parameters in a simple and computationally efficient model and the representation
        of important physical parameters.  The ETRM uses incident shortwave radiation (Rsw), a modeled albedo with
        a temperature-dependent rate of decay, and air temperature (T air) to find snow melt. Flint and Flint (2008)
        used Landsat images to calibrate their soil water balance model, and found that a melting temperature of 0C
        had to be adjusted to 1.5C to accurately represent the time-varying snowpack in the Southwest United
        States; we have implemented this adjustment in the ETRM.

        melt = (1 - a) * R_sw * alpha + (T_air -  1.5) * beta

        where melt is snow melt (SWE, [mm]), ai is albedo [-], Rsw is incoming shortwave radiation [W m-2], alpha is the
        radiation-term calibration coefficient [-], T is temperature [deg C], and beta is the temperature correlation
        coefficient [-]
        Albedo is computed each time step, is reset following any new snowfall exceeding 3 mm SWE to 0.90, and decays
         according to an equation after Rohrer (1991):

         a(i) = a_min + (a(i-1) - a_min) * f(T_air)

        where a(i) and a(i - 1) are albedo on the current and previous day, respectively, a(min) is the minimum albedo of
        of 0.45 (Wiscombe and Warren: 1980), a(i - 1) is the previous day's albedo, and k is the decay constant. The
        decay  constant varies depending on temperature, after Rohrer (1991).

        This function is important because mass balance errors indicate a problem in the soil water balance or
        in the dual crop coefficient functions.
        Think of the water balance as occurring at the very top of the soil column.  The only water that comes in
        is from rain and snow melt.  All other terms in the balance are subtractions from the input.  Runoff, recharge,
        transpiration, and stage one and stage two evaporation are subtracted.  Soil water storage change is another
        subtraction.  Remember that if the previous time step's depletion is greater than the current time step
        depletion, the storage change is positive.  Therefore the storage change is subtracted from the inputs of rain
        and snow melt.

        To do: This function is complete.  It will need to be updated with a lateral on and off-flow once that model
